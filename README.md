### What I like

* As detailed and complete specification as possible
* Static typing, dynamic binding
* Functional programming
* Actor Model of computation
* Simple/flat data
* Everything as data (first-class values)
* Separate functions and data. Combine only when it's needed.
* Rust, Erlang, Lisp
* No significant whitespace
